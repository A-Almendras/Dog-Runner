### **_Description_**

#### Dog runner is a browser game where the dog will collect bones by avoiding obstacles when presented. The dog will keep running until it collides with a barrier, ending the game.

### **_Getting Started_**

##### The game will initiate with the dog running towards an obstacle. Once the dog approaches the barrier, the user must determine when to click the page to activate the jump. If the dog's jumping time is off, it will collide with the obstacle causing the user to lose the game. Timing the jumps is key to winning the game. The longer the run, the higher the score.

##### A Trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/axD6qkG5/project-1-dog-runner-game).

##### The project itself was deployed and can be viewed [here](https://www.google.com/).
